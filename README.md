## How It Works

The Undefeated Triangle MT5 robot trades on the AUD/CAD and NZD/CAD currency pairs using a triangle trading strategy. It first checks for open positions and performs the following actions based on the position's profitability:

- If the position is in profit, it closes the position and adds the profit to the total profit count.
- If the position is in loss, it calculates a new lot size using the martingale strategy and modifies the position with the new lot size.

If there are no open positions, the robot checks for previous orders. If there are previous orders, it calculates the grid level based on the total orders count and places new orders at the grid level for the AUD/CAD, AUD/NZD, and NZD/CAD currency pairs. It then increases the total orders count.

If there are no previous orders, the robot places initial orders for the AUD/CAD, AUD/NZD, and NZD/CAD currency pairs. It also increases the total orders count.

The robot continuously monitors the total profit and total orders count, providing real-time updates.
